# College Management
__This is a final unit project of Programming Module. 1st course of CFGS DAW.__

*It was developed with Java SDK 11 and Ant library.*

1. This is a simple program with basic administration functions of a Univeristy. It allows the user to see different types of lists: all members, students, PhD students,  teachers and each subject available with its related members. It also allows to search or delete a member by its ID.

2. This project intends to be a way to practice OOP fundamentals using all the knowledge aqquired in this unit and the previous ones. While developing this program I worked and consolidated the following topics:

	- Encapsulation
	- Methods and their overload
	- Use of static and non static methods
	- Hierarchy: sub/super classes
	- Inheritance
	- Abstract classes and methods
